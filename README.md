# Massage App Backend
This repository is for the backend API database storage for a simple massage booking application. I built the API with Ruby on Rails and deployed it with Heroku. This is the first solo project that I built during the third module of Flatiron School's immersive software development program. This project was built in one week. The frontend is built with vanilla JavaScript, vanilla CSS3, and HTML5. You can finnd that repo here. https://github.com/christy-inman/massage-app-frontend
